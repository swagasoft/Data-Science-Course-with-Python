Example 1. Element-wise basic arithmetic operations
# We print fruits for reference
print('Original grocery list of fruits:\n ', fruits)

# We perform basic element-wise operations using arithmetic symbols
print()
print('fruits + 2:\n', fruits + 2) # We add 2 to each item in fruits
print()
print('fruits - 2:\n', fruits - 2) # We subtract 2 to each item in fruits
print()
print('fruits * 2:\n', fruits * 2) # We multiply each item in fruits by 2 
print()
print('fruits / 2:\n', fruits / 2) # We divide each item in fruits by 2
print()


# We import NumPy as np to be able to use the mathematical functions
import numpy as np

# We print fruits for reference
print('Original grocery list of fruits:\n', fruits)

# We apply different mathematical functions to all elements of fruits
print()
print('EXP(X) = \n', np.exp(fruits))
print() 
print('SQRT(X) =\n', np.sqrt(fruits))
print()
print('POW(X,2) =\n',np.power(fruits,2)) # We raise all elements of fruits to the power of 2




Example 3. Perform arithmetic operations on selected elements
# We print fruits for reference
print('Original grocery list of fruits:\n ', fruits)
print()

# We add 2 only to the bananas
print('Amount of bananas + 2 = ', fruits['bananas'] + 2)
print()

# We subtract 2 from apples
print('Amount of apples - 2 = ', fruits.iloc[0] - 2)
print()

# We multiply apples and oranges by 2
print('We double the amount of apples and oranges:\n', fruits[['apples', 'oranges']] * 2)
print()

# We divide apples and oranges by 2
print('We half the amount of apples and oranges:\n', f



Example 4. Perform multiplication on a Series having integer and string elements
# We multiply our grocery list by 2
groceries * 2
