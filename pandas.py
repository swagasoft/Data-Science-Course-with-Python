Example 1 - Create a Series
# We import Pandas as pd into Python
import pandas as pd

# We create a Pandas Series that stores a grocery list
groceries = pd.Series(data = [30, 6, 'Yes', 'No'], index = ['eggs', 'apples', 'milk', 'bread'])

# We display the Groceries Pandas Series
groceries




Example 2 - Print attributes - shape, ndim,and size
# We print some information about Groceries
print('Groceries has shape:', groceries.shape)
print('Groceries has dimension:', groceries.ndim)
print('Groceries has a total of', groceries.size, 'elements')


Example 3 - Print attributes - values, and index
# We print the index and data of Groceries
print('The data in Groceries is:', groceries.values)
print('The index of Groceries is:', groceries.index)


Example 4 - Check if an index is available in the given Series
# We check whether bananas is a food item (an index) in Groceries
x = 'bananas' in groceries

# We check whether bread is a food item (an index) in Groceries
y = 'bread' in groceries

# We print the results
print('Is bananas an index label in Groceries:', x)
print('Is bread an index label in Groceries:', y)
